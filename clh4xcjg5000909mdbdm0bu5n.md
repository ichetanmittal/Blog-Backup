**Blockchain technology** has revolutionized the world in the past few years, and with it, a plethora of blockchain-based platforms have emerged. [`SHARDEUM`](https://shardeum.org) is one such platform that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent months. SHARDEUM is a community-driven blockchain that has been making waves within the Web3 community. It is an EVM-based, linearly scalable smart contract platform that provides low gas fees forever while maintaining true decentralization and solid security through dynamic state sharding. Built on the principles of *Openness*, *Collaboration*, and *Community-Driven* approach, the platform is committed to being open to discussions, information, ideas, documents, and just about anything. SHARDEUM is also committed to collaborating with anyone who is trying to achieve a similar goal of increasing blockchain adoption. Finally, the platform is community-driven, with the community being at the forefront of key decisions.

The SHARDEUM platform has been gaining a lot of traction in recent months, and one of the reasons for this is its commitment to being community-driven. The platform's developers have recognized that the success of any blockchain-based platform is dependent on the support of its community. By putting the community at the forefront of key decisions, SHARDEUM can build a platform that truly meets the needs of its users.

At the SHARDEUM workshop, I attended in Gurgaon, I was impressed with the depth of knowledge shared by the platform's developers. They were able to explain complex concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and I left the workshop feeling energized and motivated to learn more about blockchain and Web3. The workshop covered a wide range of topics, from the basics of blockchain technology to more advanced topics such as dynamic state sharding. The developers also demonstrated how the SHARDEUM platform works, and how it can be used to build decentralized applications.

Inspired by my experience, I decided to organize a workshop for my college, **NIT Jalandhar**, with the help of the **GDSC** team. We invited two industry experts to share their insights and experiences about the Web3 and blockchain space, and we also discussed how SHARDEUM is leading the way in creating a community-driven platform that empowers users and developers.

The workshop for NIT Jalandhar was a huge success. Students from various departments attended the workshop, and they were impressed with the depth of knowledge shared by the speakers. The speakers were able to explain complex concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and they provided real-world examples of how blockchain technology is being used in various industries.

The GDSC team played a crucial role in organizing the workshop. They helped with everything from connecting with the right speakers to promoting the workshop on campus. With their help, we were able to create an environment where students could learn about blockchain technology and its potential applications.

As someone passionate about the potential of blockchain technology, I am committed to contributing to the SHARDEUM platform in any way I can. Whether it's through writing blogs, organizing workshops, or engaging with the community, I believe that SHARDEUM has the potential to make a real difference in the world of blockchain and beyond.

The SHARDEUM platform is unique in a way that it provides low gas fees forever by adding on new [<mark>nodes</mark>](https://docs.shardeum.org/node/types) continuously which also contirbutes to the decentralization. This is a major advantage over other blockchain-based platforms, which often charge high fees that can be prohibitive for some users. By providing [`low gas fees`](https://docs.shardeum.org/), SHARDEUM can make blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience.

SHARDEUM's commitment to openness, collaboration, and community-driven approach has made it one of the most promising platforms in the Web3 space. The platform's developers have a strong focus on scalability and security, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to build [`decentralized applications`](https://shardeum.org/ecosystem/).

All in all , the event has been a great learning for me , it gave me opportunity of networking , and connecting with the like-minded. As per the response of audience , we are on our way to open a separate blockchain society where we could connect with more of blockchain community and students could find out a career path out of it.
